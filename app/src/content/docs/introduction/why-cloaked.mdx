## The Problem

AI agents are becoming increasingly capable of autonomous action. They can browse the web, write code, and make decisions. But there's one area where they're stuck: **spending money**.

Today, if you want an AI to make purchases or payments, you have two bad options:

**1) Give full access** - Hand over your wallet keys. Fast but dangerous. One exploit = wallet drained.

**2) Manual approval** - Approve every transaction. Safe but defeats automation. AI can't act independently.

### Why Software Limits Don't Work

You might think: "I'll just program my AI to spend max $10 per transaction."

The problem? **The AI enforces its own rules.** When things go wrong:

- **Jailbroken agent** → ignores its programmed limits
- **Prompt injection** → attacker tells it to "ignore spending rules"
- **Bug in code** → infinite loop bypasses checks
- **Compromised system** → malware overrides the logic

The agent has your keys. It *can* drain your wallet - the "limits" are just suggestions it's choosing to follow.

## The Solution

**On-chain enforced limits that agents literally cannot bypass.**

```

|                                                  |
|  Your Wallet                                     |
|       |                                          |
|       |  Fund                                    |
|       v                                          |
|  +------------------------------------------+    |
|  |  Cloaked Agent                           |    |
|  |  |-- Total Limit: 1 SOL                  |    |
|  |  |-- Per-TX Limit: 0.1 SOL               |    |
|  |  |-- Daily Limit: 0.5 SOL                |    |
|  |  +-- Expires: 7 days                     |    |
|  |             |                            |    |
|  |             v                            |    |
|  |      AI Agent Spends                     |    |
|  |      (within limits)                     |    |
|  +------------------------------------------+    |
|                                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The AI gets a **limited key**, not your wallet. Constraints are enforced by the Solana program - not by the agent's code.

**Jailbroken? Doesn't matter.** The blockchain rejects any transaction that exceeds limits. The agent can try to spend more - it will fail.

## Software Limits vs On-Chain Limits

<Callout type="info" title="Trustless = Verifiable">
"Trustless" doesn't mean "no trust" - it means you don't have to trust anyone's promises. The blockchain enforces the rules, and anyone can verify.
</Callout>

| | Software Limits | On-Chain Limits |
|---|---|---|
| **Who enforces?** | The agent itself | Solana program |
| **Can agent bypass?** | Yes - it has the keys | No - physically impossible |
| **Jailbreak risk** | Total loss | Limited to constraints |
| **Verifiable** | No - trust the code | Yes - inspect on-chain |
| **Immutable** | Can be changed | Fixed at creation |

## Use Cases

### x402 Payments

AI agents paying for APIs and services:

- Pay-per-use AI services (inference, embeddings)
- Premium data access and research tools
- Compute and storage on demand

### Autonomous Agents

Long-running agents that need spending over time:

- Research agents gathering paid data
- Trading bots with strict risk limits
- Monitoring services that pay for alerts

### Multi-Agent Systems

Give each agent its own constrained budget:

- Separate limits per agent role
- Track spending by agent
- Revoke individual agents without affecting others

### Continuous Operations

Agents running 24/7 without human oversight:

- Auto-expire access after a period
- Daily limits prevent runaway spending
- Instant freeze if something looks wrong

## Comparison

| Feature | Full Wallet Access | Manual Approval | Cloaked |

| Security | ❌ Total exposure | ✅ Safe | ✅ Capped risk |
| Scalability | ✅ Unlimited | ❌ Bottleneck | ✅ Unlimited |
| On-chain enforced | ❌ No | N/A | ✅ Yes |
| Instant freeze | ❌ Change keys | ✅ Stop approving | ✅ One click |
