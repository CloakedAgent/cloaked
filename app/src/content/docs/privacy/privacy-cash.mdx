## What is Privacy Cash?

[Privacy Cash](https://privacycash.org/) enables anonymous funding of Cloaked Agents. Instead of depositing directly from your wallet (which links you to the agent), you can break the chain using Privacy Cash.

Privacy Cash is a ZK privacy protocol on Solana using **Merkle tree commitments** and **zero-knowledge proofs** to break the link between deposits and withdrawals.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <span>**Deposit** SOL from your wallet to Privacy Cash pool</span>
  <span>**Wait** for mixing (more deposits = better privacy)</span>
  <span>**Withdraw** to the Cloaked relayer wallet</span>
  <span>**Relayer creates** your agent on-chain (you never sign)</span>
  <span>**Result**: No on-chain link between your wallet and the agent</span>
</Steps>

## The Relayer Flow

When creating a private agent via Privacy Cash, you're not funding the vault directly. Here's the actual flow:

```
Your Wallet → Privacy Cash Pool → Relayer Wallet → Agent Creation
```

1. **You withdraw from Privacy Cash** to the Cloaked relayer wallet (not directly to your agent)
2. **Relayer confirms** receipt of your deposit transaction
3. **Relayer creates the agent** on-chain, paying all rent and transaction fees
4. **Relayer keeps 0.01 SOL** as a creation fee (covers rent + operational costs)
5. **Remaining funds** go to your agent's vault

<Callout type="info" title="Why This Flow?">
Your wallet never signs the agent creation transaction. The relayer acts as an intermediary, so there's no on-chain connection between your wallet and your agent. The 0.01 SOL fee covers the account rent (~0.00139 SOL) plus relayer operational costs.
</Callout>

**Example:** You withdraw 0.5 SOL from Privacy Cash to the relayer.
- Privacy Cash fees: ~0.008 SOL (0.35% + 0.006 network fee)
- Relayer receives: ~0.492 SOL
- Relayer keeps: 0.01 SOL (creation fee)
- Your vault receives: ~0.482 SOL

<Callout type="warning" title="Minimum Recommended: 0.1 SOL">
We recommend funding at least 0.1 SOL to create a private agent. Smaller amounts get eaten by fees. The combined fees (Privacy Cash + Cloaked creation) total roughly 0.018 SOL minimum.
</Callout>

## Using Privacy Cash (Frontend)

Privacy Cash is integrated into the Cloaked web app:

1. Connect your wallet
2. Navigate to "Fund Agent"
3. Select "Privacy Cash" funding method
4. Deposit SOL to your private balance
5. Fund your agent from private balance

<Callout type="info">
Privacy Cash in the Cloaked web app handles all the complexity for you - just deposit and fund your agents.

## Privacy Best Practices

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Privacy Tip">
**Never deposit to Privacy Cash and fund your agent with the same amount at the same time.** This makes it trivial to link your wallet to the agent. Instead:
- Deposit a larger amount than you need
- Wait hours or days before funding
- Fund with a different amount than you deposited
</Callout>

## Fees

**Privacy Cash fees** (charged by Privacy Cash protocol):

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Withdrawal fee | 0.35% of amount |
| Network & rent | 0.006 SOL |

**Cloaked creation fee** (charged when creating a private agent):

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Agent creation | 0.01 SOL |

The creation fee covers account rent and relayer operational costs. It's deducted from your Privacy Cash withdrawal before funding the vault.

## Technical Details

Privacy Cash uses:

- **Zero-knowledge proofs** - Prove withdrawal rights without revealing deposit
- **Merkle tree commitments** - Deposits stored as hashed commitments
- **Poseidon hashing** - ZK-friendly hash function
- **Browser WASM** - Client-side proof generation

## Limitations

- **Pool size** - Privacy depends on number of participants
- **Timing analysis** - Large or unusual amounts are easier to trace
- **Not instant** - Best privacy requires waiting between operations

<Callout type="info">
Privacy strength depends on pool activity. More deposits = harder to trace. Don't rush operations.
