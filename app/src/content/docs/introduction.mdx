## What is Cloaked?

Cloaked is a protocol for creating **trustless spending accounts** for AI agents on Solana. It solves a fundamental problem: how do you give an AI agent the ability to spend money without trusting it completely?

<Callout type="tip" title="The Problem">
AI agents need to make transactions autonomously, but giving them full wallet access is dangerous. What if they malfunction? What if they get jailbroken or compromised?
</Callout>

With Cloaked, you can:

- **Set spending limits** that are enforced on-chain
- **Create constraints** (per-transaction, daily, total, expiration)
- **Revoke access instantly** if something goes wrong
- **Keep your keys safe** - agents never touch your main wallet

## Key Concepts

### Cloaked Agents

A Cloaked Agent is a spending account with built-in constraints. It has its own keypair (the "agent key") that can only spend within the limits you define.

```typescript
const agent = new CloakedAgent(agentKey, rpcUrl);

// Agent can spend up to its limits
await agent.spend({
  destination: new PublicKey("..."),
  amount: 100_000_000  // 0.1 SOL in lamports
});

// But cannot exceed them - enforced on-chain!
```

### Constraints

Constraints define what an agent can and cannot do:

- **Total Limit**: Maximum SOL the agent can ever spend
- **Per-Transaction Limit**: Maximum per single transaction
- **Daily Limit**: Maximum per 24-hour period
- **Expiration**: When the agent's access ends

### Privacy Modes

Cloaked supports two privacy modes:

1. **Standard Mode**: Your wallet is publicly linked to the agent
2. **Private Mode**: Zero-knowledge proofs hide the ownership link

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <span>**Create a Cloaked Agent** - Define spending limits and constraints</span>
  <span>**Fund the account** - Deposit SOL into the agent's vault</span>
  <span>**Give the agent key to your AI** - It can now spend within limits</span>
  <span>**Monitor and manage** - Track spending, adjust limits, or revoke access</span>
</Steps>

The magic is in the **on-chain enforcement**. Even if an AI agent tries to spend more than its limit, the Solana program will reject the transaction. There's no way to bypass the constraints.

## x402 Support

Cloaked natively supports the [x402 payment protocol](/docs/ai-agents/x402) - the emerging standard for machine-to-machine payments. AI agents can automatically pay for premium APIs, compute, and content with the `cloak_x402_fetch` tool.

## Why Solana?

Cloaked is built on Solana because:

- **Low fees**: AI agents can make frequent small transactions economically
- **Fast finality**: Transactions confirm in seconds
- **Programmable**: Custom on-chain programs enforce constraints
- **Growing AI ecosystem**: MCP servers, AI agents, and autonomous systems
